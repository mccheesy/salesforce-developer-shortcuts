# Salesforce Developer Shortcuts

A super simple Chrome-compatible extension that provides
shortcuts to launch Dev Console or Setup when on a Chrome
tab for a Salesforce org. Checks the current tab for a
Salesforce domain, appends the desired path, and pops it
in a new __tab__.

## Defaults

Open Dev Console: `[Ctl|Cmd] + Shift + d`
Open Setup: `[Ctl|Cmd] + Shift + s`
Open Object Manager: `[Ctl|Cmd] + Shift + o`

## Configuration

The keyboard shortcuts can be customized from the extensions
page in a Chrome-based brower.

## Why?

It always bugged me getting to Dev Console, especially that
it would open in a weird browser popup window from 2003. I
tried another browser extension that did something similar,
but didn't provide any config.
